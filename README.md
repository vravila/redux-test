-Used this project to learn more about the functionality of Redux

Main points learned:
- Redux helps give each React component the exact piece of state it needs
- The state of the whole Redux application lives in the store
- Reducers produce the state of your application based on action type
- Reducers take 2 parameters: the current state and an action
- The state is immutable and cannot change in place
- The only way to change the state is by sending a signal to the store (action)
- Every action needs a type property
- Constants should be used to better define action types to minimize errors
- To ensure state remains immutable, use concat(),slice() for arrays, Object.assign() for objects

Methods:
- subscribe() : accepts callback that will fire when action is dispatched
- dispatch() : dispatching an action
- getState(): accesses current state of the app




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
